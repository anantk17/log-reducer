zxcvbnmasdfghjklqwertyuiopqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmA few weeks ago, some
guy in a shitty bmw parked in my 'reserved and paid for' parking spot in a small lot. I printed out
an A4 (helvetica demi bold 12pt) note stating that this was a paid for parking spot and not to park
there again. A couple of days later he parked there again. I printed out an A3 (helvetica black
42pt) sign stating 'Reserved Parking, Do not park here' sign and used spray adhesive (3MÂ®) to
mount it on the wall in front of my spot. When I went to park in my spot the next day he had
written in texta, after "Reserved Parking', the words 'For Wankers'. About three days later I
saw his car parked in the street so I printed out a poster in A2 (helvetica black, 92pt, reversed)
 with the word 'Fuckhead' and applied it with spray adhesive to his windscreen, ensuring (as per inst
 ructions) I sprayed both materials to be bonded. The disadvantage of course is that I am too scared
 \to park in my spot but he is also too scared to park there so I will class this as a draw for th
 e moment and find a new spot.When I was in year ten, I would wag school to catch the bus into the
 city. I would hide the contents of my schoolbag and go to a christian book store called the 'Open
 Book', covering two levels and a second hand section in the basement. I would go in with my empty
  bag, select expensive theological volumes, and fill my bag with several hundred dollars worth. I
  would then use the toilets to remove any price tags before going downstairs to the basement where
   they would buy my books for half the retail price. I did this twice a week. I figured that if
   they caught me I would cry and ask for their forgiveness and as christians they would have let
   me go but they never caught on. I remember one person buying the entire Amy Grant tape collection
   when it had been on the shelves not ten minutes before. I was saving for a motorbike and bought
   a Suzuki Katana. The 'Open Book' went broke a year later so it worked out well for everyone.
