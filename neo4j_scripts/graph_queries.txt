Graph we're dealing with: 5868 edges

Nodes with no relationships:

Query: MATCH (n) WHERE NOT (n)--() RETURN COUNT(n)
Result: 14

Count the number of nodes with ‘y’ number of hops:

MATCH (x)-[:SYSCALL*y]->() RETURN Count(x)

Replace x with the number of hops. Here SYSCALL is the type of relationship

0: 4107
1: 2932
2: 81055
3: 0

Longest Path: 2 hops
Shortest Path: 1 hop

Count the number of nodes with outgoing number of hops between 0 and 1:

MATCH (x)-[:SYSCALL*0..1]->() RETURN Count(x)

7039 = 4107 + 2932

Count the total number of edges

MATCH (n)-[r]->() RETURN COUNT(r)
5868
